// Graphql wants to fix inconsistencies or challenges around
// restful routing and tackle big issues around overserving data

// Restful routing has issues in 3 areas
// 1. Deciding a url schema gets tough when we start to have heavily nested relationships
// 2. When fetching heavily nested data we can get into situations where we make too many http requests to get the data we need
// 3. Vulnerable to over fetching data
